# POSIXClock.jl
Julia bindings for POSIX Clock.

# Scope
The initial scope of this Julia package is to expose PREEMPT_RT capabilities to Julia users. The long-term goal is to provide cross-platform wrapping of POSIX clock_*() functions similar to [node-posix-clock](https://github.com/avz/node-posix-clock) and [posix-timer](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/posix-timer).
